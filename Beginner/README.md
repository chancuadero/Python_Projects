1. [Number Guessing Game](number_guessing.py)<br>
   Built a simple Number Guessing Game to practice using the random module, while loops, and conditional statements.<br>
   The goal was to familiarize myself with conditional logic and the implementation of Python modules.<br>
   Successfully developed the game by researching documentation and utilizing Google to master the random module.<br>
   <br>
2. [Word Guessing game](word_guessing.py)<br>
   Created a simple Word Guessing Game to practice using while loops, conditional statements, append to a list.<br>
   The goal was to strengthen my logical thinking by simulating a word-guessing mechanic. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the user must guess the word letter by letter.<br>
   Successfully developed the game by breaking down the logic into smaller components.
3. [Hangman Game](hangman_game.py)<br>
   Created a simple Hangman Game to practice implementing different list methods and indexing.<br>
   The goal was to familiarize with the usage of list methods and other built-in functions to successfully achieve the project's objectives.
4. [21 Number Game](number21_game.py)<br>
   Developed a simple 21 Number Game to practice using custom and built-in functions.<br>
   The goal was to familiarize with using custom functions and improve logical thinking.<br>
5. [Rock-Paper-Sciccors Game](RPS_game.py)<br>
   Created a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game to practice using dictionaries, conditional statements, custom/built-in functions, and the random module.<br>
   This project helped me improve my logical thinking and my ability to loop through dictionaries. My goal was to get comfortable using custom functions with multiple parameters and to ensure the program validates user input. I implemented logic so that if a user enters anything other than a digit, the program repeatedly asks for the correct input instead of crashing.<br>
6. [Compare PDF](compare_pdf.py)<br>
   Created a script to read two files if they are identical or not.<br>
   Utilized gemini AI to explain the hashlib module and how to read pdf files.<br>
   The goal was to familiarize with usage of modules, reading files in python, usage of while loops, and custom functions.<br>
