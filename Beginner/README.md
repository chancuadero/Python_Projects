2. Word Guessing Game<br>
   Created a simple word guessing game to practice using while loops, conditional statements, append to a list.
   The goal was to strengthen my logical thinking by simulating a word-guessing mechanic. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the user must guess the word letter by letter.
   Successfully developed the game by breaking down the logic into smaller components.
