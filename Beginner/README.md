1. Number Guessing Game
   Built a simple number guessing game to practice using the random module, while loops, and conditional statements.
   The goal was to familiarize myself with conditional logic and the implementation of Python modules.
   Successfully developed the game by researching documentation and utilizing Google to master the random module.
